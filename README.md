This is pretty much the final LFR that I am ever going to work on. I was bored out of my mind and a competition was coming up so i sort of decided to update my previous code for easier PID tuning and then the final version of code without any wifi so that i don't really get disqulaified from any other competitions.

The basic hardware setup of this includes:
         1) ESP32 (30 Pin variation)
         2) TB6612FNG motor driver
         3) Buck converter (LM2596)
         4) Boost converter (generic)
         5) 2x3.7V Li-ion cells
         6) QTR sensor array
         7) N20 motor drivers and wheels
